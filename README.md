# Alhamdulillah
## This is by the grace of my Lord
Alhamdulillah I created this Weather App, using REACT, TAILWIND, I challenged myself to create this mini app to apply what i've learned this weak, async await, fetch with axois and more without watching any tutorial and alhamdulillah it ends up with this mini app.

That was really enjoyable.

## What's next?
In Sha ALLAH the next project will be an E-commerce website, it will be a big challenge for me because I want to do it with full stack using REACT(FE) and EXPRESS(BE) and POSTGRESQL(DB), refreshing my knowledge about array methods, and a lot more thing, In sha ALLAH I want to use typescript in my future projects and I think it will be much easier for me to use it because I use to use java and as you all know it is hard typed language, so I'm really familiar with that, Alhamdulillah.
